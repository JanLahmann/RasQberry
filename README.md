## The RasQberry project: Exploring Quantum Computing and Qiskit with a Raspberry Pi and a 3D Printer

[Quantum Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) - which is based on Quantum Mechanics - is a complex technology that is hard to understand for most people. Completely new algorithms - and even new thinking - is needed to exploit the potential power of upcoming quantum computers. This requires new approaches to teach Quantum Computing in engaging and understandable ways for IT experts, developers and young academics.

RasQberry integrates [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), a Raspberry Pi (the full range from Pi 4 down to a Pi Zero) and a 3D printed model of [IBM Q System One](https://www.research.ibm.com/quantum-computing/system-one/) to explore various state of the art technologies and create a tool that can be used in meetings, meetups, demo booths, etc. A spectrum of Quantum Computing demos and Serious Games for Quantum Computing (that illustrate superposition, interference and entanglement) will be made available on this device for an engaging introduction to Quantum Computing.

## Qiskit on Raspberry Pi
A first discription how to install Qiskit on a Raspberry Pi is available at http://ibm.biz/Qiskit-Raspberry-Medium. It also includes a description how to setup some quantum demos (Qrasp, Raspberry-Tie) based on a Sense Hat 8x8 LED display.

A summary of that article has been published at hackster.io: https://www.hackster.io/news/jan-and-robert-lahmann-get-a-quantum-computer-running-on-your-raspberry-pi-in-under-30-minutes-4b972010009d
