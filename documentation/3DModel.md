## 3D model
An enclosure (3D model) of the IBM Q System One can be used for RasQberry. STL files are available at https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry_enclosure (original source: https://github.com/BAndiT1983/RasQberry_enclosure). This is based on an idea of Andy Stanford-Clark (https://github.com/andysc/IBM-Q-System-One-3D-model). Additional instructions for assembling the enclosure and all components (Raspberry Pi, 4'' touchscreen display, battery pack inside the enclosure, etc) will be provided later.
