# How to use your RasQberry
In this document you can find information on how to use your RasQberry

## Start your RasQberry
On the opposite site of your touch display you can see a hole, which is big enough to insert your stilo pen. By inserting th pen and pressing the button **once** you turn on the battery.<br/>
On the right side from the touch display you can see a bigger hole. This is big enough for a USB-C Charger to recharge the battery if necessary.

When you click this icon you open the kivy user interface in which you can navigate through the demos and serious games.

## The Applications Menu
In the Applications Menu you can find all RasQberry Demos.<br>
Under **Demos** you'll find the Demos that you can use with your touch display and the LED Lights.<br/>
Under **HD Demos** you'll find the Demos we would recommend using a larger screen or the second VNC Screen.<br/>
